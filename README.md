Libraries for Insight Plugins
=============================

This project contains common libraries to be used with [Insight Plugins](https://github.com/insight/sandboxed-ui-plugins/).

The sub-packages contain releases of third party libraries with minor modifications to make them loadable as [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/)
packages.

Insight clients should make these libraries available to plugins without the plugin needing to bundle them where possible and applicable.
